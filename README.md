This is the first Scala Assignment for KUP.
In this Assignment we neeed to built a command line parser.
For this programming assignment, we are supposed to write a cli-flag parser in Scala. You're supposed to define your own flags - as is the case with the gannounce utility(written in Golang).


Usage: clip options [message]
 -d => It shows Todays date 
 -h => help 
 -rp => It print the reverse of the string Inputed
